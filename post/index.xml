      <description>Top Gun has a lot to teach us about software development. Through a recent viewing, I noticed a number of useful parallels and perpendicular. Significant spoilers ahead
Parallels Th crises that the Top Gun staff face are different from the crises that a software developer faces. However, we can still learn from their approaches to failure and learning.
On failed deployments  Viper: The simple fact is you feel responsible for Goose and you have a confidence problem.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: The Weave folk now say Weave is kinda fast: http://weave.works/weave-docker-networking-performance-fast-data-path/ In our new world of containers Docker, many old problems have been rediscovered. Thankfully, the fact that these problems were solved decades ago has not stopped people from coming up with their own solutions, and we now all get to witness the resulting disasters.
The particular problem I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about today is IP level overlay networks. The basic problem these overlay networks try to solve is &amp;ldquo;I have 1 IP per machine, but I need a subnet multiple IPs per machine&amp;rdquo;.</description>
